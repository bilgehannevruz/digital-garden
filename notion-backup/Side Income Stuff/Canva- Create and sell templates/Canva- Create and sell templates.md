Are you tired of theories and want to create Canva templates to sell?

Then this is your Mastery guide.

  

I’ve been creating designs for ==Twitter, Pinterest, and eBook templates for about 2 years== now.

Thus, I’m a better choice to learn Canva monetization from.

Right?

  

This course is for professional designers and also for beginner designers who want to create templates and make money selling it online.

### You’re going to learn:

- How to find templates to sell
- How to create
- And lastly to sell!

___________________________________________

### Let’s find templates that you’ll be creating to sell:

How do one find templates that are profitable and easy to create?

  

We’re going to find the template in the Canva app?

==Why in Canva?==

  

Because Canva has its pro option and there we can find some pro templates that you can copy and sell on other platforms.

  

**See how:**

Go to Canva.com

Click on Social media (I’m choosing Social media templates but you can choose whatever you!)

![[Canva.com_then_click_on_Social_media_.png]]

I’m choosing Instagram in social media templates but you can choose Twitter, Linkedin etc

![[Instagram_.png]]

Scroll down:

See templates: Now click on: **See all**

![[Templates-_See_all.png]]

Now:

You’ll see this:

![[Crown_emoji-sign_means_pro.png]]

A page like this will appear in front you.

  

What you’ve to do is select the “Crown sign/emoji” template.

Why?

Because thats our template product we’ll be creating to sell (not that)

  

Now friends you’ve got choose which pro template you want to create and sell.

It depends. Like on Instagram the Typography posts and carousal perform well, so,I’m choosing it.

  

Next step:

Click on it to see what it is.

![[Pro_template_looks_.png]]

You’ll be doing the same as I’m doing to create a pro template on Canva free version.

  

We’ll just take inspiration and start your own unique template to create and then sell it on Gumroad or any platform you want.

  

How to take inspiration from:

1. See what colors that person has used.
2. The fonts
3. The images
4. The elements

After these go to Canva.com

And create a design.

  

For me it is Instagram Carousal:

![[Search_your_template_or_create_.png]]

And if you want you can create a Custom size template too.

  

You’ll see this:

![[You_can_get_helped_by_choosing_one_from_Templates_and_get_started.png]]

You can choose from the templates. But I’m going to teach you how to create from nothing. Just pure creation.

  

Now Jump again to the tab of “ pro inspiration template”:

And see the colors, elements and everything.

  

Done. Now get started.

(For your info I’m designing this from scratch just to teach you how to create templates, Okay!)

  

You shouldn’t create the same template but different with a same vibe.

Got it!

  

I suggest for colors: Coolors.com

Best place to choose gradient and color palette for desgins.

![[Coolors.com_Color_palette.png]]

Now choose your brand color or clients brand color and get started:

I’m going to choose this:

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T06-45-07.887Z.png]]

Now to create our first page:

![[I_created_this_(Not_bad_right!).png]]

This is wack. I know.

You shouldn’t create one like this. Your product template should look more like these:

![[Crown_emoji-sign_means_pro 1.png]]

If you don’t know Canva.

# Selling your Templates:

Before getting into selling and all that…

Copy the link.

  

Yes, to sell your Canva templates you’ll have to share the link of your templates with your Clients, and Customers:

  

If you want to sell Canva templates as digital product then click on Share to get the template link:

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T07-14-15.551Z.png]]

Your customers can edit and do whatever they want with it but it won’t change the actual template for you and for others. Thats good, right?

  

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T07-23-55.319Z.png]]

Copy that link.

After copying that Template link:

  

Go to Canva home and search: Link

![[Search_link.png]]

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T07-30-29.847Z.png]]

Click on that and Edit it:

![[Click_on_Your_template_.png]]

When you open that Link poster, edit as I did or create something more interesting and minimalist than mine.

  

Click on Your Template.

![[click_on_three_dots.png]]

No click on the 3 dots on up right.

![[Link_added.png]]

Click on that link button and then add your link there.

  

Click done. And your Template link is added to that “Your Template”.

Whenever someone clicks on that they will be redirected to your template.

  

Download the Link picture in: PDF standard form

Now Customizing the Gumroad page for your Templates.

  

We’ll use Gumroad to sell your templates. Gumroad is great for selling digital products, yes it is expensive but the payment method and product customization are top-level.

  

You can’t compromise with that.

## ==Gumroad customization:==

I’ll teach you this in my style.

  

It won’t be great but you’ll be able to:

- Add product
- Write description
- Publish
- Share on Social media (Marketing)

I think this is more than enough to create a product and publish.

## Add product:

First go to Gumroad.com

Sign up account.

  

Next:

![[Gumroad-_Click_on_products.png]]

Click on “Products” to create a product.

![[Click_on_New_product_to_create.png]]

  

Now click on “New product” to create product

![[Custom.png]]

  

You’ll see a page like this when you click on “New product”:

Now - **Give a name to your product.**

  

For me this will be: Instagram Carousel for creators (==you can give any name you want!==)

And **Type**: Digital product.

  

And down there you’ll see price: Put there anything you want.

I suggest and Gumroad professionals suggest starting with a zero can have many benefits.

  

One of them are:

- Free emails
- Customers
- Reviews

So start with Zero ($0)

  

Now **Customization** of your product starts here:

![[Image.png]]

  

This page is your product sales page:

**First:**

Write a descriptive and persuasive description for your product.

  

**What’s inside your product?**

**Why anyone should buy your product?**

**Does it solve any problem?**

**Why do people need your product?**

  

Answer these questions in your description and create a great offer.

  

Now: URL

![[URL.png]]

Put your product name or any URL you want. Basically this is for your product.

So write a relevant URL. For me: instagramcreators

  

Add a HD cover.

![[HD_cover.png]]

After that thumbnail and then real thing starts…

![[Product_info.png]]

Add a summary…

![[details_.png]]

Click on Add details:

And write:

What inside the product of yours…

  

If I’m adding details for this product that I’m building it will be:

Like this.

Pages: 100

Visuals: 100+

Access: Lifetime

And more.

  

You got the idea, right?

Let pricing be $0. And in suggestion add $5+ or anything you want.

  

Now **Contents**:

![[Linkpicture_Content_Gumroad.png]]

When someone buys your product they’ll see this content page of your product…so customize it well.

  

Write:

Here’s your product:

  

And upload your PDF here.

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T18-06-36.063Z.png]]

Click on that to upload your PDF file.

After uploading

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T18-08-51.835Z.png]]

And setting up the page completely…Click on “Save and Continue” Last step

  

![[Firefox_Screenshot_2023-02-11T18-10-03.366Z.png]]

  

You can edit this page too but leave it for now.

  

To publish click on “Publish and continue”…

Hurray! you’ve created a digital product.

  

## Marketing

Now that you’ve published a product on Gumroad no one would buy it until you market it.

To market it you’ve to use Social media.

  

I suggest using Twitter.

Use Twitter to sell your products.

  

And if your product is related to Instagram then sell it thereby creating engaging and captivating content to catch eye and make people use their credit cards to give you money.

  

On Twitter:

Write content that can help people.

  

Create a cult-like following on Twitter by:

- Writing helpful tweets and threads
- Engaging in comments
- DMing creators to use your templates or share them.

  

Do this for 2 months and see results.

  

You’ll be amazed by the fact that why didn’t you start on Twitter sooner?
