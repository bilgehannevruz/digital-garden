Summary: The NIPT New Reference project involves creating references with different sample sizes and bin sizes, as well as splitting the data into train and test sets. The findings from another team highlight the importance of gray area increase as a sign of noise and the stability that comes with increasing the number of samples. There is a question about whether a power test should be applied and how to do so.

## Description

- Create reference with
    - 500 samples
    - 2500 samples
    - 5000 samples
    - 250.000 binsize
    - 500.000 binsize
    - 1.000.000 binsize
- Split train/test data

## Findings from other team

- Gray area increate is important, it is sign of noise
- Number of samples increase the stability

  

## Questions

- Power test? should it be applied, if so, how?
