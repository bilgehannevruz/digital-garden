## Why

The way AI-powered apps are built has changed:

- Before LLMs, an idea would bottleneck on training models from scratch, and then it'd bottleneck again on scalable deployment.
- Now, a compelling MVP based on pretrained LLM models and APIs can be configured and serving users in an hour.

An entirely new ecosystem of techniques, tools, and tool vendors is forming around LLMs. Even ML veterans are scrambling to orient themselves to what is now possible and figure out the most productive techniques and tools.

## What

We put together a two-day program based on emerging **best practices** and the **latest research results** to help you make the transition to building LLM apps with confidence.

We ran that program as an in-person bootcamp in San Francisco in April 2023. Now, we're releasing [the recorded lectures](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/llm-bootcamp/spring-2023/), for free!

What do I need to know already?

The lectures aim to get anyone with experience programming in Python ready to start building applications that use LLMs.

Experience with at least one of machine learning, frontend, or backend will be very helpful.

## Who

We are [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/). We're a team of UC Berkeley PhD alumni with years of industry experience who are passionate about teaching people how to make deep neural networks work in the real world.

Since 2018, we have taught in-person bootcamps, online multi-week cohorts, and official semester-long courses at top universities.
