Research shows that developers complete tasks [55% faster](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) at [higher quality](https://github.blog/2023-10-10-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-code-quality/) when using GitHub Copilot, helping businesses accelerate the pace of software development and deliver more value to their customers. We understand that adopting new technologies in your business involves thorough evaluation and gaining cross functional alignment.

To jump start your organization’s entry into the AI era, we’ve partnered with engineering leaders at some of the most influential companies in the world to create a new expert-guided GitHub Learning Pathway. This prescriptive content will help organizational leaders understand:

- What can your business achieve using GitHub Copilot?
- How does GitHub Copilot handle data?
- What are the best practices for creating an AI governance policy?
- How can my team successfully roll out GitHub Copilot to our developers?

Along the way, you’ll also get tips and insights from engineering leaders at ASOS, Lyft, Cisco, CARIAD (a Volkswagen Group company), and more who have used GitHub Copilot to increase operational efficiency, deliver innovative products faster, and improve developer happiness!

### Learning Pathways are organized into three modules:

- **Essentials** modules introduce key concepts and build a solid foundation of understanding.
- **Intermediate** modules expand beyond the basics and detail best practices for success.
- **Advanced** modules offer a starting point for building deep expertise in your use of GitHub.

We are hard at work developing the next GitHub Copilot Learning Pathway module, which will include a deep dive into the nitty-gritty of working alongside your new AI pair programmer. We’ll cover best practices for prompt engineering and using GitHub Copilot to write tests and refactor code, among other topics.
